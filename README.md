# UrlShortenerProject
This project allows users to convert Long Urls to Short Urls

This application is used do converter an Url into an Short Url.

When the user adds an Url the Url is past from Frontend applcation Spring Boot using REST Api.
The Url is then inserted into embedded H2 Database. A short Url is generated by taking primary key and converting to Base 62.
The generated value us then added to customer url "emurl/<Base62 conversion>" and persisted to the dB.

I created two Dockerfile to deploy to Deploy.
One for the Java jar and java executable.
Other for node and Angular 6 application.

## To Deploy to Docker:
#### For Spring Boot Server:
* Open docker terminal
* Navigate inside Server/demo 
* docker build -f Dockerfile -t demo .
* docker run -p 8080:8080 demo


#### For Angular Client:
* Open another docker terminal
* Navigate Client/UrlClient
* docker build -t urlclient:prod .
* docker run -p 80:80 urlclient:prod
